## module 3 challenge

Below are two separate assignments, PyBank and PyPoll, each with their own unique script and analysis.

## PyBank

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzed the financial records of budget_data.csv to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, with the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits with the date and amount over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits with the date and amount over the entire period

## PyPoll

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzed the votes within election_data.csv and calculated each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
